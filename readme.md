## Overview

<!-- TODO: To be changed -->
<!-- The following are just sample -->
This project is a Header and Footer Gallery consisting of 5 static and 5 animated designs for both Header and Footer Designs. In this project, I was able to showcase my knowledge of HTML and CSS. I mainly used multiplayer games such as Dota, League of Legends, and Overwatch for my designs in this project. The key components in this project are the Header Gallery Page and Footer Gallery Page.

## Rules, Practices and Principles
1. Always use `WD-` in the front of the Title of the Project for the Subject followed by your custom naming.
2. Do not rename any .html files; always use `index.html` as the filename.
3. Place Files in their respective folders.
4. All file naming are in camel case.
   - Camel case is naming format where there is no white space in separation of each words, the first word is in all lower case while the succeding words first letter are in upper followed by lower cased letters.
   - ex.: buttonAnimatedStyle.css
5. Use only `External CSS`.
6. Renaming of Pages folder names are a must, and relates to what it is doing or data it holding.
7. File Structure to follow below.

```

└─ assets
|   └─ css
|   |   └─ style.css
|   └─ img
|   |   └─ fileWith.jpeg/.jpg/.webp/.png
